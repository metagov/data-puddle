# Iswe community assembly platform (Assemblis)

## Platform structure
This platform comes in two halves:
1. A tool to help you plan and run an impactful, live community deliberation and record the actions decided upon therein.
2. A data repository with rich, automated analysis, aggregating the outputs of all assemblies.

Interoperability occurs in between. The outputs from (1) can go to another analysis platform or repository. The inputs to (2) can come from another process or repository.

## Data structure
These in/outputs contain:
- configuration and context data
- descriptions of the actions decided upon (in a specific 'actions framework' format
- survey data to help evaluate the process for quality and learning/solidarity outcomes
- any other available text or audiovisual formats available

A json file showing the structure is included in this folder, as is a file containing dummy data for 100 assemblies.

## More info
- Platform website still in development. For now, this platform is part of an initiative for a permanent global citizens' assembly, [see here](https://iswe.org/blog/launchoftheglobalcitizensassemblyforpeopleandplanet).
- Platform code will be open and ready to share at some point in 2025.

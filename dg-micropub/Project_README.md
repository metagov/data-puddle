# Discourse Graph Evidence Micropublications

This project explores how deliberation can be improved by making scientific evidence interoperable with deliberation tools and processes. When proposals and comments include empirical claims, direct engagement with relevant evidence can help participants calibrate their certainty, surface productive areas for discussion, and make more informed decisions. Our approach centers on curating machine-readable feeds of evidence at the claim level (rather than only at the paper or dataset level), using formats like nanopublications that are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). By aligning units of scientific argument (claims) with units of deliberation (comments/arguments), we aim to enable people to bring relevant, structured evidence directly into deliberative contexts. The claims for this project are created using the Discourse Graph formalism and an experimental plugin in the hypertext notebook Roam that enabled export of claims into a [Nanopublication](https://nanopub.net/) format, as part of the larger Discourse Graph project, which seeks to develop a scalable, decentralized ecosystem for curating and publishing interoperable evidence.
